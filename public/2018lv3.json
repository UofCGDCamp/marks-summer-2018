Your program also gives errors from the Camera built-in class because you have an extara camera layer that is not needed.

Good job on modifying the joystick to include the flip function. You should use hitTestPoint instead of hitTestObject when programming many walls. I beat your game with 791 points! Good job putting save data on it as well. I wish you all the best in the future and hope that you will join us on some Saturdays!"
